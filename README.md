# Data-science-Algorithms-in-PHP
This is a repository explaining Data science Algorithms in PHP and describes when to use it and when not to use it.


This repository is inspired by a video created by ForestKnight on Youtube. I want to 
brush up on my algorithms, so i decided to implement and explain all the logarithms.

For context, here is the original video.
